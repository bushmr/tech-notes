## Episode 1
**Security**  

Recently I was following a tweet thread where @eric_capuano mentioned his  
disastisfaction with Nessus and asked for alternative recommendations from  
the twitterverse.  The net/net from my view was that three main things came  
out of it.  Rapid7 InsightVM, Qualys, and Nuclei got many mentions.  Also  
mentioned was that all vuln scanners stink but that the above (including  
Nessus were the tops).
