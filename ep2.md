## Episode 2
** Networking **
I've been doing infrastructure for over 20 years.  
One thing that has always eluded me has been IPv4 subnetting.  
I mean, I've always know what subnet mask to use and the range of IPs  
in the VLAN etc.  But since I've mostly been a Server and Storage guy  
it was never up to me to decide how many IPs a subnet needed (except for a cert test).  
So as I've moved more to the cloud, it's become more needful for me to  
understand CIDR notation and this site [Networks, Subnets, and CIDR] (https://erikberg.com/notes/networks.html)  
has really helped.
